# LangChain-Runnables-Practical-Implementation-Guide
This repository demonstrates the modern Runnable architecture in LangChain using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).  It covers practical implementations of:  RunnableSequence  RunnableParallel  RunnableBranch  RunnablePassthrough  The project focuses on understanding how LangChain builds execution graphs using composable Runnables.
